# Behavioural suite for the fact compiler (#733), first consumer of the fact
# model (#731) and the freshness contract (#732).
#
# Those two shipped as DATA that nothing read. This is where every ambiguity in
# them surfaces first, so the suite is written against the shipped schema rather
# than against strings copied out of it: the identifier grammars, the required
# envelope fields and the status vocabulary are READ FROM preferences/fact-model.tsv
# and applied to what the compiler emitted. A fact that satisfies a hand-written
# expectation but not the schema would pass a test and fail the contract.
#
# The three things under test that a happy-path check would miss:
#
#   * an unreadable source is an UNKNOWN with a stated reason, never a smaller
#     success and never a surviving previous value;
#   * one node is read ONCE for every field of its fact — a per-field fan-out
#     could observe the same node in three states and manufacture a conflict;
#   * the source version is the node's updated_at, never its id, because an id
#     is stable across every change and would make a stale fact look current.
